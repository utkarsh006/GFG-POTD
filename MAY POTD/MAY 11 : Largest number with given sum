/* Geek lost the password of his super locker. He remembers the number of digits N as well as the sum S of all the digits of his password. 
He know that his password is the largest number of N digits that can be made with given sum S.
As he is busy doing his homework, help him retrieving his password.

Input:
N = 5, S = 12
Output:
93000
Explanation:
Sum of elements is 12. Largest possible 
5 digit number is 93000 with sum 12.   */

    //with sum equal to given sum.
